Star Chores
Exterior Property Cleaning

This site is a work in progress for a client who runs a Star Wars-themed exterior cleaning company.

Tech Stack

I've used React as the main framework/front-end for the site, CSS for styling, and some Javascript.

The React Table library has been used for the price tables.

Form submission and mailing is handled by a third-party service Formspree.
